### 🌊🌊🌊

Hello. I'm [Glenn Hitchcock](https://glenn.me), a designer who holistically plays across brand, product and process. Generalism is the spice of life.

- ▲ I’m currently directing design at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Pushing marketing design pipeline, levelling up design systems, innovating on brand and pushing product.
- 💎 I previously led product design at [Sketch](https://sketch.com). Founded design systems, processes, directed designers and product teams, and reimagined brand.
- ⛽️ I also led design at [Fueled](https://fueled.com) for a long time. Built a NYC & LDN design team from a team of 1.
- 💬 When I'm not heads down, I [tweet](https://x.com/glennui).
